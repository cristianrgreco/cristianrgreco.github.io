We're ready to deploy some apps to our cluster, but we haven't figured out yet how to handle sensitive data. When we deploy our observability stack (Prometheus, Grafaka and Loki), we'll need to create an admin password to be able to login. We'll also need to provide an email address where we'll receive our alerts. This is information we do not want to make publicly available.

== Next Steps

Stay tuned for the next post where we'll deploy Prometheus, Grafana and Loki, with custom alerts that will email us when our server CPU/memory/disk utilisation, and even temperature, is too high. We'll end up with something like:
