= Secret Management on Your Home Server with Flux and Sealed Secrets
:page-excerpt: Secure your sensitive data with Flux and Sealed Secrets, enabling safe Git storage and Kubernetes deployment.
:page-tags: [flux, kubernetes, gitops, sealed-secrets]
:page-published: true

We're ready to deploy some apps to our cluster, but we haven't yet figured out how to store sensitive data. 

When we deploy our observability stack (Prometheus, Grafaka and Loki), we'll need to create an admin user to be able to login. We'll also need to define an email address where we'll receive our alerts. This is not information we want to make public, yet it would be ideal if we could store it in source control to track it, change it, and share it with other contributors. For example maybe you want your colleague to rotate the password, or maybe they also want to be emailed when alerts fire.

The concept we're looking for here is called "encryption at rest".

> Encryption at rest is a process that protects data that is stored on a disk or backup media (in our case in files in our Git repository) by scrambling it so that it can only be decrypted with a key.

To achieve this we'll be using https://github.com/bitnami-labs/sealed-secrets[Bitnami's sealed secrets], the use of which is also https://fluxcd.io/flux/guides/sealed-secrets/[well documented by Flux].

== Create the Flux Manifests

In a link:/2024/11/21/bootstrap-your-home-server-with-kubernetes-and-flux.html[previous post], we set up a Kubernetes cluster on our home server and ran Flux bootstrap. Flux created a Git repository in your name,  which we now need to clone down and modify. Its content will look like this:

[source]
----
.
└── clusters
    └── production <1>
        └── flux-system 
            ├── gotk-components.yaml
            ├── gotk-sync.yaml
            └── kustomization.yaml

4 directories, 3 files
----
<1> You can define states for several clusters. In our case we'll just have the one. We'll call our home server "production".

Create `/clusters/production/infrastructure.yaml`:

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  name: infra-controllers
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 10m0s <1>
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: flux-system
  path: ./infrastructure/controllers <2>
  prune: true <3>
  wait: true <4>
  timeout: 5m0s
----
<1> Flux will monitor the Git repository for changes at the given path every 10 minutes. This means that when you push a change, it can take up to 10 minutes for Flux to detect the change and start reconciling. This interval can be made more or less aggressive depending on your needs.
<2> The path in the Git repository to monitor for changes. Note that we are not pointing to a specific file, rather to a whole directory. That's because we can have many infrastructure components. Flux will look for a `kustomization.yaml` file in this directory, similar to an `index.html` for a website. We'll create this file shortly.
<3> Flux will remove the resources if they are removed from Git. This ensures the cluster state matches what's in Git.
<4> Flux will wait up to 5 minutes before marking the reconciliation as failed if it hasn't completed within that time.

Create `/infrastructure/controllers/sealed-secrets.yaml`:

[source, yaml]
----
---
apiVersion: source.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1
kind: HelmRepository
metadata:
  name: sealed-secrets
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 24h <1>
  url: https://bitnami-labs.github.io/sealed-secrets

---
apiVersion: helm.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v2
kind: HelmRelease
metadata:
  name: sealed-secrets
  namespace: flux-system
spec:
  interval: 30m <2>
  chart:
    spec:
      chart: sealed-secrets
      sourceRef:
        kind: HelmRepository
        name: sealed-secrets
      version: "2.x" <3>
  releaseName: sealed-secrets-controller
  targetNamespace: flux-system
  install:
    crds: Create
  upgrade:
    crds: CreateReplace
----
<1> Poll the Bitnami Helm chart repository every 24 hours for new releases.
<2> Every 30 minutes, check if a new release matching our criteria is available.
<3> The versions we will allow Flux to deploy. `2.x` means if our current version is `2.0.0`, we'll automatically accept an upgrade to `2.0.1` or `2.1.0`. By keeping the major version the same, we shouldn't run into any breaking changes. This assumption is based on https://semver.org/[semantic versioning].

Create `/infrastructure/controllers/kustomization.yaml`:

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: kustomize.config.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
resources:
  - sealed-secrets.yaml
----

The resultant structure should look like this:

[source]
----
.
├── clusters
│   └── production
│       ├── flux-system
│       │   ├── gotk-components.yaml
│       │   ├── gotk-sync.yaml
│       │   └── kustomization.yaml
│       └── infrastructure.yaml
└── infrastructure
    └── controllers
        ├── kustomization.yaml
        └── sealed-secrets.yaml

6 directories, 6 files
----

== Apply the Flux Manifests

Before we apply the manifests, let's SSH onto the server and start watching for Flux events:

[source, bash]
----
flux events --watch <1>
----
<1> `flux events -w` for short.

Now for the beauty of Flux. Simply commit and push the changes, and we'll soon see Flux kick in:

[source]
----

----

Flux detected the change in Git. Observed that the cluster state differs from what's in Git, and reconciled the difference. We see `ReconciliationSucceeded`, meaning everything went through. Indeed, there's a new pod running in the cluster:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl get pods -n flux-system -l app.kubernetes.io/name=sealed-secrets
----

[source]
----
NAME                                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
sealed-secrets-controller-769d7d7bb4-x9n5h   1/1     Running   0          20h
----

== Create Our First Secret

When the sealed-secrets pod starts for the first time, it generates a public and private key pair. We can use the public key to encrypt our secrets. The encrypted secrets can be stored in Git without risk of being decrypted (as long as the private key is kept safe). The encrypted secrets can be applied into the cluster, where sealed-secrets is able to decrypt them with the private key and create regular secrets within the cluster. Here's how that looks:

[plantuml, format=svg]
----
Actor Developer
Participant PK as "Sealed Secrets Public Key"
box Kubernetes Cluster
  Participant SS as "Sealed Secrets"
  Participant SSP as "Sealed Secrets Pod"
  Participant Secrets
endbox

== Encrypt secret ==
Developer -> PK: Encrypt secret
activate PK
return Encrypted secret
deactivate PK

== Create sealed secret ==
Developer -> SS: Create sealed secret\ncontaining encrypted secret
activate SS
return Sealed secret created
deactivate SS

== Decrypt sealed secret and create regular secret ==
SSP -> SS: Found sealed secret
activate SSP
activate SS
return Decrypted secret
deactivate SS
SSP -> Secrets: Create secret
activate Secrets
return Secret created
deactivate Secrets
deactivate SSP
----

=== Extract the Sealed Secrets Public Key

Kubeseal (which we installed in the first post with Ansible) can pull the public key directly from the sealed secrets pod. Let's do that and save it to `~/pub-sealed-secrets.pem` on the server:

[source, bash]
----
kubeseal --fetch-cert \
    --controller-name=sealed-secrets-controller \
    --controller-namespace=flux-system \
    > ~/pub-sealed-secrets.pem
----

=== Create a Sealed Secret

Let's create a test secret for demo purposes. First, we'll create a regular secret containing our super secret password:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl -n default create secret generic test-secret \
  --from-literal=password='super-secret-password' \
  --dry-run=client -o yaml \
  > test-secret.yaml
----

This will create a file called `test-secret.yaml` with the following contents (`cat test-secret.yaml`):

[source, bash]
----
apiVersion: v1
data:
  password: c3VwZXItc2VjcmV0LXBhc3N3b3Jk
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: test-secret
  namespace: default
----

This manifest is *not* safe to commit. The password is just base64 encoded and can be easily decoded by anyone:

[source, bash]
----
$ echo "c3VwZXItc2VjcmV0LXBhc3N3b3Jk" | base64 -d
super-secret-password
----

Let's now turn `test-secret.yaml` into a sealed secret:

[source, bash]
----
kubeseal --format=yaml --cert=pub-sealed-secrets.pem \
  < test-secret.yaml > test-secret-sealed.yaml
----

This will create a file called `test-secret-sealed.yaml` with the following contents:

[source, bash]
----
apiVersion: bitnami.com/v1alpha1
kind: SealedSecret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: test-secret
  namespace: default
spec:
  encryptedData:
    password: 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
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      name: test-secret
      namespace: default
----

Hell yeah! Now _this_ is a file that we can safely commit to Git, as only _our_ sealed secrets pod can decrypt it.

=== Apply the Sealed Secret

[source, bash]
----
kubectl apply -f test-secret-sealed.yaml
----

Let's have a look at the sealed-secrets pod logs:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl logs -n flux-system -l app.kubernetes.io/name=sealed-secrets
----

[source]
----
time=2024-11-23T23:47:53.552Z level=INFO msg=Updating key=default/test-secret
time=2024-11-23T23:47:53.572Z level=INFO msg="Event(v1.ObjectReference{Kind:\"SealedSecret\", Namespace:\"default\", Name:\"test-secret\", UID:\"fe5f0f76-3fd0-4d89-bb20-3843d7e205f1\", APIVersion:\"bitnami.com/v1alpha1\", ResourceVersion:\"43686\", FieldPath:\"\"}): type: 'Normal' reason: 'Unsealed' SealedSecret unsealed successfully"
time=2024-11-23T23:47:53.583Z level=INFO msg="update suppressed, no changes in spec" sealed-secret=default/test-secret
----

The logs are telling us that a secret has been created. Let's have a look:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl get secrets -n default
----

[source]
----
NAME          TYPE     DATA   AGE
test-secret   Opaque   1      5s
----

Let's have a look at `test-secret`:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl get secret/test-secret -n default -o yaml
----

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
data:
  password: c3VwZXItc2VjcmV0LXBhc3N3b3Jk
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2024-11-23T23:47:53Z"
  name: test-secret
  namespace: default
  ownerReferences:
  - apiVersion: bitnami.com/v1alpha1
    controller: true
    kind: SealedSecret
    name: test-secret
    uid: fe5f0f76-3fd0-4d89-bb20-3843d7e205f1
  resourceVersion: "43688"
  uid: 10824c16-390d-42e6-81ed-19906436fe9d
type: Opaque
----

That password looks similar to the base64 encoded password from earlier:

[source, bash]
----
$ echo "c3VwZXItc2VjcmV0LXBhc3N3b3Jk" | base64 -d
super-secret-password
----

=== Summary

We're able to get our secret with the pasword `super-secret-password` into the cluster from our sealed secret, which contains the encrypted password. This means we can now safely store our secrets in Git! Encryption at rest achieved.

== Next Steps

In the next post we'll be deploying Prometheus, Grafana and Loki, with custom alerts that will email us when our server CPU/memory/disk utilisation, and even temperature, get too high.
