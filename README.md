This repo was bootstrapped from https://gwenneg.com/2024/08/17/blogging-with-minimal-effort.html, which provides an AsciiDoc template using the Minimal mistakes theme.

Post ideas:
- Flux deployments
  - Why flux, use PlantUML to show GitOps vs traditional flow
- Multiple VMs with Ansible and KVM with Virgl. Hardware switching with script. Benefits such as upgrading OS, failing, rollback, etc.
